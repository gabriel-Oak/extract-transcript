No time to setup a whole environment now, just this. And good luck solving the many
crashes in versions and packages that will appear in the future. Remember to use python 3.10 
for pyannote ¬¬

```bash
alias transcript="python3.10 $HOME/Projects/extract-transcript/main.py"
```

```bash
pip install whisper openai-whisper pyannote-audio torch torchvision torchaudio
```
